# Equatorial-Guinea-Geospatial-Analysis-and-Visualization

---> RUN CODE ON GEE

This code snippet demonstrates the geospatial analysis and visualization of Equatorial Guinea using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It includes layers for slope analysis, gross primary productivity (GPP), normalized burn ratio thermal (NBRT), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

- Gross Primary Productivity (GPP): GPP represents the rate at which solar energy is converted into organic matter through photosynthesis by plants. It is an important measure of ecosystem productivity and can indicate the health and vitality of vegetation.
  - Color codes: GPP values are represented by a palette ranging from low (red) to high (green) productivity, with shades of yellow indicating intermediate levels.

- Slope: Slope refers to the steepness or inclination of the terrain surface and is calculated from elevation data. It provides information about the topography of an area, influencing factors such as water flow, erosion, and land use suitability.
  - Color codes: Slope is typically visualized using a color gradient, where lower slopes are represented in shades of blue or green, moderate slopes in yellow, and steeper slopes in shades of orange or red.

- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): NDVI measures the amount of live green vegetation in an area by analyzing the difference between near-infrared and red light reflected by plants. It is commonly used to assess vegetation health, monitor changes in land cover, and estimate crop yields.
  - Color codes: NDVI values range from -1 to 1, with negative values representing water and non-vegetated surfaces (e.g., barren land), low values indicating sparse or stressed vegetation (e.g., deserts), and high values indicating dense, healthy vegetation (e.g., forests), often depicted in a color gradient from red (low) to green (high).

- Normalized Burn Ratio Thermal (NBRT): NBRT is a measure of thermal infrared radiation emitted by burned and unburned surfaces following a wildfire. It helps identify burned areas, assess fire severity, and monitor post-fire recovery.
  - Color codes: NBRT values range from 0 to 0.9, with higher values indicating more severe burns and typically displayed in a color palette transitioning from blue (low) to yellow (moderate) and red (high severity).
